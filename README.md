# MachineDataAnalysis
Here You can find my projects which I prepared for my Machine Data Analysis labs.

- **Segmentation** -> A program that will allow segmentation of car models, using clustering methods: KMeans, GMM, DBSCAN,

- **SVD** -> Singular Value Decomposition represented at trivial example and at the image,

- **Inertion-Silhouette** -> A program that thanks to inertion and silhouette score will help to decide what is the most optimal number of colors to reproduce the image.
